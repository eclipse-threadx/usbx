07/10/2009  USBX generic code version 5.3. This release includes the following 
            modifications:

            ux_api.h                                    Changed to included new memory alignment values and TraceX events and objects,
                                                        and changed timeout value for control transfers from 1 second to 5 seconds
                                                        as some devices need a bit more time to reply to the first control request.
            ux_device_class_rndis.h                     Added a mutex to protect queuing/dequeuing of packets between the application and the RNDIS xmit thread.
            ux_host_class_storage.h                     Ensure the SCSI CBW and CSW buffers are aligned on 32bit and do not rely on the compiler packing pragma
                                                        some DMA engines of certain OHCI controllers (SH7727 in particular) requires all OHCI data buffers
                                                        to be aligned on 32 bits even though OHCI does not demand it. 
            ux_dcd_at91_transfer_callback.c             Fixed missing update of actual_length field on out transmission, and added support for Control Out 
                                                        data payload in the Atmel AT91 controller.
            ux_dcd_at91_transfer_request.c              Fixed missing update of actual_length field on out transmission.
            ux_device_class_rndis_bulkin_thread.c       Added a mutex to protect queuing/dequeuing of packets between the application and the RNDIS xmit thread, and
                                                        fixed problem when dequeuing multiple NetX packets to be sent.
            ux_device_class_rndis_initialize.c          Added a mutex to protect queuing/dequeuing of packets between the application and the RNDIS xmit thread.
            ux_device_class_rndis_write.c               Added a mutex to protect queuing/dequeuing of packets between the application and the RNDIS xmit thread.
            ux_hcd_ehci_asynch_td_process.c             Update the ux_ehci_ed_first_td field with the next td to allow USB transactions of more than 16 spanning 
                                                        multiple SOFs, and only look for transfer errors if the Halt bit of the QTD is set.
            ux_hcd_ehci_interrupt_endpoint_create.c     Filter for interval 1 when we anchor on the last ed in the tree.
            ux_hcd_ehci_interrupt_endpoint_destroy.c    Check for the forward link of the QED and ensure it is not NUL before attaching the previous QED.
            ux_hcd_ehci_request_interrupt_transfer.c    Check for no QTD allocation.
            ux_hcd_ehci_transfer_abort.c                Fixed a bug when cleaning TDs after an abort.
            ux_hcd_isp1161_interrupt_endpoint_create.c  Filter for interval 1 when we anchor on the last ed in the tree.
            ux_hcd_ohci_interrupt_endpoint_create.c     Filter for interval 1 when we anchor on the last ed in the tree.
            ux_hcd_pic32_interrupt_endpoint_create.c    Filter for interval 1 when we anchor on the last ed in the tree.
            ux_hcd_sh2a_interrupt_endpoint_create.c     Filter for interval 1 when we anchor on the last ed in the tree.
            ux_host_stack_device_resources_free.c       Filter for no interface attached to a configuration before reading the current alternate setting, which 
                                                        would cause a crash in systems where reading from address 0 is illegal.
            ux_host_stack_endpoint_instance_delete.c    Filter for physical endpoint allocation when freeing device resources.                                                        
            ux_utility_memory_allocate.c                Allow safe alignment of DMA memory for controllers which do not support scatter/gather memory - the field 
                                                        UX_ENFORCE_SAFE_ALIGNMENT needs to be defined otherwise alignment defaults to the default.

            ux_hcd_isp1362                              Added support for the ISP1362 host controller, the following files have been added:

            ux_host_class_pima_activate.c               Now, the class and the instance are passed
            ux_host_class_hub_activate.c                back to the application if the callback function
            ux_host_class_hid_activate.c                is registered.
            ux_host_class_cdc_acm_activate.c            All the files below have been modified:

            ux_device_stack_control_request_process.c   Keep the Interface target command inside the device stack and do not forward to the class(es).
            
            ux_device_stack_configuration_get.c         Data payload now goes through the ux_device_stack_transfer_request function.
            ux_device_stack_get_status.c                Data payload now goes through the ux_device_stack_transfer_request function.

            ux_device_class_storage_thread.c            Check for exact CBW length and STALL Bulk In/Out endpoints if wrong length.
                                                        STALL Bulk In/Out endpoints if CBW header does not have the right signature.

            ux_host_class_storage_activate.c            Allocate the storage instance from CACHE_SAFE memory to ensure the SCSI
                                                        CSW buffer is in a cache safe memory region.
                                                                    
            ux_api.h                                    Removed class structures back into their own specific .h files
                                                        to improve readability, all host classes .h files have also been modified
                                                        accordingly.
            ux_user.h                                   Added several configurable parameters for memory constraint environment like PIC32
            us_port.h                                   Like above, also changed the USBX thread priorities to 1 for HCD and DCD and 2 for 
                                                        the enumeration thread and other classes. Changed the string UX_SYSTEM_HOST_INIT to UX_SYSTEM_INIT
            ux_system_initialize.c                      Changed the string UX_SYSTEM_HOST_INIT to UX_SYSTEM_INIT
            ux_host_class_hub_activate                  Change the hub instance state to activated before starting the interrupt pipe.
            ux_hcd_ehci_asynch_td_process.c             Properly release the last TD when an error occur during the transfer
            ux_hcd_ehci_done_queue_process.c            Discovered a bug when parsing the interrupt tree in search for the range of frame
                                                        entries to scan. The algorithm is now simpler and all the entries are parsed.
            ux_hcd_isp1161_least_traffic_list_get.c     When looking for the list with least traffic, ignore the static EDs.
            ux_hcd_ohci_initialize.c                    Force the periodic start default value of the HC_PERIODIC_START register.
                                                        Some OHCI controllers needs this register to be set manually, others default
                                                        to some value upon reset.
            ux_hcd_ehci_asynchronous_endpoint_create.c  Bug found when setting the cap0 register of the ED. If the endpoint is a control endpoint,
                                                        the QH-CEF bit must be set.         
            ux_hcd_sh2a                                 Added support for variants of the SH2A USB host controller (SH7670 and SH7263)
